# Gesture recognition with edge AI in ESP32 microcontroller

**Real‑time gesture recognition** on the **Waveshare ESP32‑S3 Touch LCD 2.8"** using **Edge AI**.  
This project covers the full workflow — from collecting gyroscope data, to training a lightweight neural network, to deploying it for on‑device inference — all running locally on the ESP32 with a **touchscreen LCD** interface.

## 📋 Project Workflow

### **1. Data Collection**
- Arduino sketch captures **gyroscope data** in **1–2 second intervals**.
- Perform **30 repetitions** for each of **two distinct gestures**.
- Save readings in **CSV format** for training.

### **2. Model Training**
- Train a **small MLP** in TensorFlow:
  - 1 fully connected layer (<100 neurons)
  - 8‑bit quantization for deployment
- Export as **TensorFlow Lite Micro** model.

### **3. Deployment**
- Arduino sketch:
  - Captures a **1‑second window** of gyroscope data on demand.
  - Runs inference locally using the TFLite Micro model.
  - Classifies the gesture and displays the result on the **touchscreen LCD**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32_gyroscope_gesture_recognition.git
   ```
2. **Follow the Software Setup** steps above.
3. **Run `data_collection` sketch** to gather your dataset.
4. **Train the model** using scripts in `model_training/`.
5. **Deploy the model** with the `inference` sketch.

## 📌 Notes
- All inference is done **on-device** — no internet connection required.
- Designed for **low-latency, low-power** gesture recognition.
- Touchscreen interface can be extended for gesture selection, calibration, or visualization.
